# README_Template

## Description

This is a professional README template designed for the coder who wants to spend more time coding and less time writing. 

- It can be cumbersome to write out an explanation of your project after hours of tedious work building it. This template is provided to aid in that area.
- My hope is that this project will aid other coders and allow them to spend more time coding and less time writing.
- I feel more confident in implementing functions, and I have a better understanding of the benefits of using multiple files.

## Installation

1. Open VS Code Terminal
2. Enter `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` into the command line

1. Open "README_TEMPLATE" in Visual Studio Code
